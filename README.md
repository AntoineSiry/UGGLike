# 🎮 UGG-Like – League of Legends Match Viewer

A lightweight application inspired by U.GG, built using **Vanilla JavaScript** and the **Riot Games API**.

## 🚀 Description

This project fetches and displays recent League of Legends games based on a player's Riot ID and PUUID.  
It supports the following game modes:

- ✅ **Solo Queue**
- ✅ **Flex Queue**
- ✅ **Arena**
- ❌ **Personal games** are **not** displayed due to API limitations during testing.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a **learning exercise**, with no prior experience in JavaScript at the time.  
My main goals were to:

- Learn and explore **JavaScript fundamentals**
- Get more comfortable using **Visual Studio Code**
- Understand how to work with a **REST API**
- Improve my **frontend/backend communication** via a proxy server using **Express.js**

## 📽️ Demo

Since the project is no longer up to date (due to the expiration of the Riot API key), here's a short video showcasing its features:
